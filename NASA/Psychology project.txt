Shaping is a conditioning paradigm used primarily in the experimental analysis of behavior. 
The method used is differential reinforcement of successive approximations. 
It was introduced by B. F. Skinner with pigeons and extended to dogs, dolphins, 
humans and other species. In shaping, the form of an existing response is gradually 
changed across successive trials towards a desired target behavior by rewarding exact 
segments of behavior.

Through shaping in basic terminology you reinforce action that you deem appropiate with 
snacks or something the subject likes. Ones the subject knowns you have something it likes
it will adjust its behaviour and actions in order to recieve more. Here is where you would 
make slight changes to what you deem as appropiate behaviour until the subject is doing as you 
please.
